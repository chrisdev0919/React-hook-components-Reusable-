# What?!
Reusable is a solution for state management, based on React Hooks.

It allows you to transform your custom hooks to singleton stores, and subscribe to them directly from any component.

The benefits:  
- Stores are decoupled from component tree
- Stores can co-depend without worrying about provider order
- It's easy to create packages that rely on global state, and plug them into apps seamlessly

# Show me the code!
Wrap your app with a provider:
```javascript
const App = () => (
  <ReusableProvider> {/* no initialization code */}
    ...
  </ReusableProvider>
)
```

And just pass your custom hooks to `createStore`:

```javascript
const useCounter = createStore(() => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  
  return {
    counter,
    increment: () => setCounter(prev => prev + 1)
  }
});
```

Then you get a singleton store, and a hook that subscribes directly to that store:
```javascript
const Comp1 = () => {
  const something = useCounter();
}

const Comp2 = () => {
  const something = useCounter(); // same something
}
```

## Selectors
You can also use selectors, and your component will re-render only if the return value changed:  

```javascript
const Comp1 = () => {
  const isPositive = useCounter(state => state.counter > 0);
   // Will only re-render if switching between positive and negative
}
```

## Using stores from other stores
Every store can use any other store, without worrying about provider order.
Just use the store's hook inside the other store:
```javascript
const useCurrentUser = createStore(() => ...);
const usePosts = createStore(() => ...);

const useCurrentUserPosts = createStore(() => {
  const currentUser = useCurrentUser();
  const posts = useCurrentUser();
  
  return ...
});
```

# What about hooks+Context?
Using plain context is not a best solution for state management, that led us to write this library:
- When managing global state using Context in a large app, you will probably have many small, single-purpose providers. Soon enough you'll find a Provider wrapper hell.
- When you order the providers vertically, you canâ€™t dynamically choose to depend on each other without changing the order, which might break things.
- Context doesn't support selectors, render bailout, or debouncing
